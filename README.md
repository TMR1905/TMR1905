**AI & Backend Developer** · Python Specialist  

I design and build intelligent backend systems that solve real business problems through automation, data processing, and AI-driven decision making.

My work focuses on creating clean, scalable architectures and production-ready AI solutions — not prototypes, but systems that deliver measurable results.

I specialize in:
- Custom AI and LLM-powered systems  
- Backend APIs and microservices (Python)  
- Automation and data pipelines  
- Scalable, maintainable system design
